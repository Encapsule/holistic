## ![](ASSETS/encapsule-holistic-24x24.png)&nbsp;Overview

### Welcome the the Holistic App Platform

Holistic app platform is a collection of modular JavaScript runtime libraries (RTL) used to build full-stack client/server applications from plug-and-play software models.

Work on is project is quite active right now as it's being used to re-design and re-implement an existing commercial SaaS product.

**PRE-RELEASE STATUS**

Holistic app platform is becoming quite stable. But, lacks examples (required) and API documentation (required). Unless you're one of a small handful of insane people (thank you insane people!) who are working with this codebase every day then you probably should just make a bookmark and come back a little later in 2020 ;-)

## ![](ASSETS/encapsule-holistic-24x24.png)&nbsp;Distribution

The @encapsule/holistic package is not currently published on npmjs.com or any other package registry.

Currently, you need to obtain the @encapsule/holistic package via `git clone` as below.

### Prerequisites

To get started you need a small set of core tools installed on your host OS:

- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - **WE ARE CURRENTLY STANDARDIZED ON NODE v12.16.1 LTS**

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (depends on Node.js) - **WE ARE CURRENTLY STANDARDIZED ON YARN v1.22.0**

```shell

root@holarchy:~# node --version

v12.16.1

root@holarchy:~# npm --version

6.14.2

root@holarchy:~# yarn --version

1.22.0

```

**IMPORTANT**

Once you have configured these baseline tools dependencies, then all other concerns related to tools and libraries dependencies are managed directly or indirectly under developer control via `appgen`.

### Clone

Execute `git clone` to obtain a copy of the @encapsule/holistic package repo from [@Encapsule](https://github.com/Encapsule) GitHub organization.

You will typically only need to clone the @encapsule/holistic package repo once.

```
$ cd ~/code # or, wherever...
$ git clone git@github.com:Encapsule/holistic.git
```

After one-time `git clone`, follow the steps outlined in the [Installation](#installation) section below.

## ![](ASSETS/encapsule-holistic-24x24.png)&nbsp;Installation

Installation of the @encapsule/holistic package from git repo source is a per-version process that should be re-executed every time you update your local clone of the repo. This includes changing branches.

- Ensure you have the latest version of @encapsule/holistic repo.

- Update your local `node_modules` directory. **IMPORTANT**

```
$ cd ~/code/holistic
$ git pull origin master
$ yarn install
```

> Be aware of the disconnect between what is present in your `node_modules` directory (managed by `yarn`). And, the state of critical `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files (managed by `git`).

- Latest supported version is available on #master branch.

- Other topic branches are used for testing features prior to release.

After you have executed `yarn install`, the [appgen](#appgen-utility) utility is ready to use.

# ![](ASSETS/encapsule-holistic-32x32.png)&nbsp;Documentation

## Holistic Applications

A **holistic application** is a developer-maintained Node.js package git repository initialized and subsequently updated with the `appgen` command-line utility.

All holistic applications maintained with `appgen` have the same basic structure and base-level feature set:

- Base-level directory structure and entry module file naming conventions.

    - Base-level directory structure is prescriptive and required.

    - Developers can extend the directory / fire structure:

        - Extend existing branches.

        - Create new directory trees rooted in the root directory.

- The `package.json` in derived holistic application packages is code-generated and owned `appgen`.

    - At inception there is only `package.json`.

    - After first `appgen` run developers should edit `holistic-app.json`.

    - `devDependencies` is managed by `appgen` and is developer-extensible via `holistic-app.json`.

    - `scripts` is managed by `appgen` and is developer-extensible via `holistic-app.json`. Platform-defined scripts include:

        - install - executed after `yarn install`.

        - clean - remove the previous application build.

        - scrub - clean and additionally delete `node_modules` directory.

        - reset - scrub and additionally clear your local yarn cache forcing complete re-stage on `yarn install`.

        - build - build the holistic application by calling `make application`.

        - server - build and start the Node.js HTTP app server on localhost.

        - debug-server - build and start the Node.js HTTP app server on localhost under Node.js inspector.

        - start - launch a previously built Node.js HTTP app server on localhost.

        - holodeck - execute your application's @encapsule/holodeck test runner.

        - appinfo - print holistic application and platform metadata.

        - platform - print holistic app platform metadata.

        - iruts - generate a batch of v4 UUID-derived IRUT-format identifier strings.

- Core application build is automated by an `appgen`-generated `Makefile`.

    - Abstracts building a holistic application so that you can launch the Node.js HTTP app server. And, service the bundled client application.

    - Does not abstract the application-specific details required to:

        - Test your holistic application.

        - Package your application for distribution (e.g. further source transformation, Dockerfile generation...).

        - Deploy your application to a cloud service provider.

    - Developers can define application-specific test, packaging, and deployment targets in `Makefile-App`.

    - Holistic application build depends on [eslint], [babel], and [webpack].

        - Configuration for these tools is imposed by `appgen` and is not currently developer-extensible.

## ![](ASSETS/encapsule-holistic-24x24.png)&nbsp;appgen Utility

### Overview

The `appgen` utility is a code generation tool used by developers to initialize and maintain **holistic applications**.

Both initialization and maintenance operations are performed using the same simple command line:

```
$ path_to_holistic/appgen --appRepoDir path_to_your_app_repo
```

Here is what happens when you execute `appgen` on your_app_repo:

- Reads or creates a default `holistic-app.json` file.

- Read your project's `package.json`.

- Remove previously installed platform runtime libraries (RTL's).

- Install new platform RTL's.

- Register platform RTL dependencies.

- Merge application and platform-defined package dependencies.

- De-duplicate and error check finalized dependencies.

- Merge platform-defined yarn integrations (e.g. run targets) with app-specific integrations.

- Merge changes back into `package.json`.

- Rewrite derived app's `package.json`.

- Initialize or recreate core project directory structure.

- Synthesize core GNU Makefile and Makefile-App files.

- Synthesize tool configuration files required by Makefile targets.

- Execute `yarn install --force --check-files`.

### Usage

#### Prerequisites

#### Initial Project Setup

- Create a directory for your new holistic application.

- Turn your directory into a git repository with `git init`.

- Turn your git repo into a Node.js package with `yarn init`.

- Commit your empty application package with `git commit -a`.
