// WARNING:
// It is perfectly valid to rebuild the application with uncommited/untracked changes.
// So we neither check nor enforce policy regarding uncommitted/untracked repo changes here.
//
// HOWEVER, as a matter of deployment policy it is strongly suggested that developers
// ensure that production builds are allowed only on git branches with no uncommitted or
// untracked changes. If this precondition is met, then the commit hash captured below
// can be used to unambiguously track a deployed application runtime back to the precise
// versions of application, platform, and tooling infrastructure used to produce the
// deployed runtime. This allows you to, for example, rebuild the version exactly in
// order to debug problems. Or, test out changes.
//
// TODO: Persist the list of uncommitted/untracked changes at the time that the buildtag
// manifest is created. Mostly we don't care. However, one might check this information
// in a deployment script and refuse to deploy untrackable test builds to the cloud.
